This django app was created for a course in mathematics from FATEC. It's not supposed to be complex or extraordinary in any way.
Simply supposed to serve for practice for this somewhat forgetful developer.

I hope it doesn't hurt anybodys eyes upon reading.


I humbly expect that you may enjoy your usage as much as I've enjoyed creating it.
